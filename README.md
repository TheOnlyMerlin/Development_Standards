Development_Standards
=====================
Development Standards
A collection of various development-related standards to try to keep projects consistent and organized.

====================
Organizational Style
====================
How will these standards be organized?
NOTE: This is an early approach and is very much subject to change.
--------------------

===========
Directories
===========
Where is everything?
-----------
/standards - This is where the actual standards are kept, in seperate, plain text files.
/reference - These are standards of other organizations.  These can be an informal compilation (looking through their systems and making your own list) or documentation from the source directly

========================
Types of Standardization
========================
Format = {$filename_suffix} - {$desc}
------------------------
naming - Naming Conventions
dir - Directory Structure
workflow - Workflow
strategy - Strategies

================================
Technologies for standardization
================================
Format = {$filename_suffix} - {$desc}
------------------------
html-tags - HTML / CSS tags
css-classes - CSS classes.  Why?  The dream is to be able to reuse CSS stylesheets across many websites.
less - CSS preprocessor
web-server - General web server stuff
web-server-apache - Web server items, specifically apache
php
c - 
cpp - 
java - 
javascript - 
project-general - Generic project standards
templating - Items related to templating languages (smarty, twig, mustache, etc).  Particularly, getting some standard variable names figured out.  The idea?  Make templating language templates far more mobile.  Ideally, you should be able to make a template file once, and have it work in many systems.
templating-smarty - 
templating-twig - 
templating-mustace -
